# Todo-step4
The Todo List application allows users to manage a list of tasks or todos. It provides features such as adding new todos, marking todos as complete, deleting todos, and filtering todos based on their completion status.

The main components of the code include:

HTML structure:

The application's HTML structure consists of various elements such as input fields, buttons, and a list to display todos.
Each todo item in the list is represented by an <li> element containing a label, complete button, delete button, and edit button.

JavaScript functions:

addTodo: This function handles the addition of new todos. It retrieves the todo title from the input field, creates a todo object, adds it to the todos array, saves the updated todos to local storage, generates the updated todo list, and clears the input field.

setLocalStorage: This function saves the todos array to the browser's local storage, allowing the todos to persist even when the page is refreshed or reopened.

clearAll: This function clears all todos. It removes the todos from local storage, resets the todos array, and clears the todo list element.

deleteTodo: This function handles the deletion of a specific todo. It finds the index of the todo in the todos array based on its ID, removes the todo from the array, saves the updated todos to local storage, and generates the updated todo list.

todosGenerator: This function generates the todo list based on the provided todos array. It iterates over the array, creates the necessary HTML elements for each todo, sets their properties and event listeners, and appends them to the todo list element.

getLocalStorage: This function retrieves the todos from local storage and initializes the todos array. It is called when the page loads to populate the todo list with previously saved todos.

Event listeners: The code includes event listeners for various actions such as clicking the add button, clearing all todos, loading the page, clicking the delete button, clicking the complete button, pressing Enter in the input field, and clicking on dropdown options.

Local storage:

The application uses the browser's local storage to store the todos array. This allows the todos to persist even when the page is refreshed or reopened.
The setLocalStorage function is used to save the todos array to local storage, while the getLocalStorage function retrieves the todos from local storage.
You can further customize and enhance the code to suit your specific requirements, such as adding additional features, improving the user interface, or integrating with backend services for data persistence.

Feel free to modify the code and add any additional explanations or context that you find relevant for your documentation or GitHub repository.
